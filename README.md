# MachineLearningCoursera
Completed exercires from Andrew Ng's introductory course on Machine Learning (https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning). The course was taught in MATLAB and went over the math behind machine learning and the different algorithms such as gradient descent, linear regression, backpropagation, K means clustering among others. The programming exercises were about implementing these algorithms on different tasks such as a spam message classifer with Support Vector Machines and a Neural Network for handwritten digit classification.
